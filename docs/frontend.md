# Frontend

As a single-page application, FastRabbit renders components using React.js in conjunction with Redux.js as the state container.

## npm

Node package manager (npm) is used to install and manage javascript modules which are used on the frontend.

## Webpack

Webpack bundles all of the frontend files after installation so the site can deploy to Heroku.

## React & Flux

All of the React components, Redux action creators, API utilities, dispatchers, and stores are located in the [frontend](../frontend) directory.

## Flexbox & Sass

Site layout, formatting, and styling are done with Flexbox and Sass. 

## Other

Other necessary frontend dependencies are:

- React DOM
- React Router
- React History to manipulating the browser history
- Babel for transpiling JSX into JavaScript.
